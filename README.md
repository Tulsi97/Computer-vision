# Computer Vision with OpenCV Library using Python

It contains my work in OpenCV python.

## Requirements
     Python 2.7 or above
     Download OpenCV from opencv.org or from sourceforge.net
     Python numpy module. ( pip install numpy)
     install cv2 python library ( pip install cv2 )
     copy cv2.pyd from opencv\build\python\2.7\x86 to c:\python2.7\Lib\site-packages

## Getting started
     
     The first thing to learn is how to load an Image, edit it and save it as a new file.
     Go through the ImageEdit.py first which will help you to learn the same.
     It takes the image.jpg and converts it to black and white and saves it as a new file 
     named blackNwhite.png
     
### Step 2
     Now you can move to the Drawing Shapes folder. There you can learn to write text,
     draw rectangles, circles, squares, and lastly you can try the altogether.py in
     which you we can draw all the shapes and text using a in a single python code.
     You can now realise the fact that drawing shapes are very mauch correlated.
